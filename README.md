# ENX-Entropy-Native-eXchange-Compressor
ENX is a minimal, high-performance binary compression tool for ultra-large numbers, engineered to match theoretical entropy limits with zero metadata, zero padding, and full roundtrip safety.  If your ciphertext can be compressed, itâ€™s leaking structure. ENX guarantees none.
